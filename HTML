          <h3>Lord Gresham</h3>
          <p>Lord Gresham, one of The FEW, commands awe and fear throughout the galaxy. He is a formidable figure with dark hair and ocean-blue eyes that turn black during intense emotions. His all-black uniform, devoid of decoration, features the glowing emblem of The FEW, and his dark red cape mirrors his emotional state, billowing and snapping without wind.</p>
          <p>At his side, he carries a sword inscribed with ancient runes that glow ominously, capable of acting as both weapon and shield. Though not an officer, he works closely with the Galactic Alliance, who are honored by his presence. The FEW, a group so rare that many never encounter them, wield immense power, easily manipulating the atmosphere and creating weather phenomena.</p>
          <p>Gresham's strategic mind and unyielding will have led his people through countless trials. Despite his stoic exterior, he found an unexpected friend in Commander Alexander Levi. Gresham is dedicated to eradicating evil and maintaining order in the galaxy.</p>

          <h3>Lady Mara</h3>
          <p>Lady Mara, with her lush blonde hair and violet eyes that darken with emotion, is a diplomatic force within The FEW. She wears the same all-black uniform with the glowing emblem, and her dark red cape reacts to her feelings. Her blue-glowing sword with ancient runes symbolizes her power and authority.</p>
          <p>Mara is known for her compassionate and empathetic nature, often using her words to resolve conflicts. However, she is fierce in pursuing justice and the greater good. Her relationship with Lord Gresham is one of deep loyalty and complex emotions, embodying the balance between fire and water within the FEW.</p>

          <h3>Commander Levi</h3>
          <p>Commander Levi, a decorated veteran of the Galactic Alliance, cuts a striking figure in his dark blue space military suit adorned with white and silver markings of honor. His light brown hair and piercing green eyes reflect both warmth and sharp intelligence. Known for his uncanny ability to read people and situations, Levi's strategic brilliance is matched only by his genuine care for those under his command.</p>
          <p>Despite his friendly demeanor and charismatic leadership, Levi carries the weight of a personal mission that sometimes puts him at odds with standard protocols. His unwavering moral compass and adaptability in crisis situations have saved countless lives and earned him the respect of both his crew and The FEW.</p>
          <p>Armed with cutting-edge technology and a mind sharp as a supernova, Levi bridges the gap between the enigmatic FEW and the rest of the galaxy. His unexpected friendship with Lord Gresham adds a layer of complexity to his role, as he navigates the delicate balance between duty to the Alliance and loyalty to his allies among The FEW.</p>
